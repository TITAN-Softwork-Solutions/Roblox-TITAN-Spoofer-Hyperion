## Features üíç

- **System Spoofing** üñ•Ô∏è Spoofs keys and cleans files that Roblox and Hyperion use to detect alt accounts.
- **Roblox Cookie Cache Cleaner** üç™ Cleans Roblox.com cookies & trackers from a specified browser.
- **Headless/NonHeadless** ‚öôÔ∏è Compile the spoofer without a command line so it can be put in startup / ran without interference. This is controlled by the `#define HEADLESS` in `Master.cpp`.
- **No System Instability** ‚ö†Ô∏è The spoofer doesn't spoof anything that'll break anything on your PC. It operates in UserMode, not the Kernel.

1. **TITAN_Spoofer.exe:**
   - Includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) navigated by arrow keys.
   - Provides an option to clear your Roblox cookie cache.
   - Use this executable if you need CLI functionality.

2. **HEADLESS_TITAN_Spoofer.exe:**
   - Does not include the CLI.
   - Does not CacheClear
   - Acts the same as the "Spoof" command in `TITAN_Spoofer.exe`.
   - Controlled by the `#define HEADLESS` directive in `Master.cpp`.

3. **Cache Cleaner:**
   - If the cache cleaner in `TITAN_Spoofer.exe` is not working, use `Python/CookieCacheCleaner.py` to clear the Roblox cookie cache.

4. **Spoofing on Startup:**
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
   - Create a shortcut to `HEADLESS_TITAN_Spoofer.exe` in the startup folder, or drag the `.exe` file there.
   - Note: This method does not work for `TITAN_Spoofer.exe` (CLI version).
