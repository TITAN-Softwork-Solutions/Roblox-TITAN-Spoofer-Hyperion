## Features üíé

- üéØ **Fully Targeted**: This spoofer targets Roblox & It's AntiCheat in specific.
- üë§ **Roblox Ban API Evasion**: The spoofer essentially negates Roblox's attempts to detect your alt accounts system side.
- üîê **Hyperion Unban**: If you're banned by Hyperion (HWID banned) the spoofer completely removes that.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No System Instability or Critical Changes**: Everything the spoofer changes should have no affect to anything else on your system.

   - Use this executable if you need CLI functionality.

2. **HEADLESS_TITAN_Spoofer.exe:**
   - Does not include the CLI.
   - Does not CacheClear
   - Acts the same as the "Spoof" command in `TITAN_Spoofer.exe`.
   - Controlled by the `#define HEADLESS` directive in `Master.cpp`.

3. **Cache Cleaner:**
   - If the cache cleaner in `TITAN_Spoofer.exe` is not working, use `Python/CookieCacheCleaner.py` to clear the Roblox cookie cache.

4. **Spoofing on Startup:**
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
   - Create a shortcut to `HEADLESS_TITAN_Spoofer.exe` in the startup folder, or drag the `.exe` file there.
