# üó®Ô∏è Info

**[TITAN's](https://titansoftwork.net/)** Spoofer is a tool designed to prevent your Main/Other accounts from being banned while exploiting on Windows/Web Roblox.

Recently, Roblox introduced it's ban API & combined it with Hyperion's (Byfron) detection system, after seeing executor developers create paid spoofers I decided to do the exploiting community a favour & make a free one.

The idea is to spoof before & after you've exploited, the Spoofer essentially gives your PC a "Clean Slate" so Roblox will have no clue who you are.

# üíé Features

- üîë **Hyperion HWID System Bypass**: Spoofs all identifiers Hyperion checks.
- üì¶ **Reinstalls Roblox**: Assuming you have Bloxstrap (And haven't put it somewhere weird) It'll use that to reinstall quickly.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Hardware Unban**: If you're HWID banned (Hyperion banned) this'll fix that for you.
- üìñ **Antiban Guide**: A complete guide to preventing getting banned & getting unbanned exists within the TITAN Discord.

<br>

# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This WILL NOT unban you if your Roblox account is banned ONSITE, that's handled server-side there's nothing I can do about that. This also applys to being banned on a specific game.

I've included TITAN.h for you to include in your software. Each spoof vector can be toggled, console logging also toggleable, its all up to you.

#### Example Integration

```cpp
#include "TITAN.h" // include TITAN.h

    std::thread TitanThread = TitanSpoofer::run(true)

    // wait 4 completion
    TitanThread.join();
```

### API

**Function: `TitanSpoofer::run(bool logs)`**

- **Params:**
  - `logs` (`true`/`false`): Controls whether logging is enabled. If `false`, suppresses all `std::cout` output except errors.
- **Return Value:** A `std::thread` object that executes the spoofing process.
