Roblox uses IOCTL_DISK_GET_PARTITION_INFO_EX to check the hardware

I've thought of 3 things that might work;

A. Hook DeviceIoControl and return false info (Not sure if Hyperion has this hooked)
B. Abuse Kernel dispatch routine to modify IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL before it reaches actual driver (This would be pointless)
C. Use the hypervisor, vmwares is locked sooo :P

PS: IOCTL_DISK_GET_PARTITION_INFO_EX isn't reliable enough to HWID ban off, so dw abt that.
