**[TITAN's](https://discord.gg/yUWyvT9JyP)** Spoofer is a tool designed to spoof various hardware identifiers (HWIDs) and cookies on your PC to evade Hyperion's detection vecs & Roblox's ban API.

Recently, Roblox introduced it's ban API & combined it with Hyperion's detection vectors, after seeing executor developers create paid spoofers I decided to do the exploiting community a favour & make a free one.

The idea is to spoof after you've exploited, before you go back onto your main. Once you're done with your main & wanna exploit again, spoof. You get the idea (Hopefully)

## Features üíé

- üéØ **Fully Targeted**: This spoofer targets Roblox in specific, meaning it spoofs exactly what Roblox checks. This is not for other games.
- üë§ **Roblox Ban API Evasion**: The spoofer essentially voids Roblox's attempts to detect your alt accounts system side.
- üíª **Hyperion Unban**: If you're banned by Hyperion the spoofer completely removes that (403 Auth err or Roblox js doesn't open)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No System Instability or Critical Changes**: Everything the spoofer changes should have no affect to anything else on your system, this is NOT kernel.
- üìö **Complete Anti-Ban Bible**: A complete Anti-Ban or "Ban Evasion" guide exists within the TITAN Discord.
