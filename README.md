# üìú Context

**[TITAN's](https://discord.gg/yUWyvT9JyP)** Spoofer is a tool designed to spoof various hardware identifiers (HWIDs) on your PC to evade Hyperion's (Byfron) detection vectors & Roblox's ban API.

Recently, Roblox introduced it's ban API & combined it with Hyperion's (Byfron) detection vectors, after seeing executor developers create paid spoofers I decided to do the exploiting community a favour & make a free one.

The idea is to spoof after you've exploited, before you go back onto your main. Once you're done with your main & wanna exploit again, spoof. You get the idea (Hopefully)

# üíé Features

- üë• **Ban API & Alt Detection evasion**: Using this gives your PC a whole new identitiy, Roblox will have no idea your alts & main are linked.
- üîê **Hyperion/HWID Unban**: If you're HWID banned (Hyperion banned) this'll fix that for you.
- üìö **Complete Anti-Ban Bible**: A complete Anti-Ban guide exists within the TITAN Discord.
